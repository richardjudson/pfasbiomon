Title: PFAS Biomonitoring and In Vitro PODs to generate Margins of Exposure
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Richard Judson
Maintainer: Richard Judson <judson.richard@epa.gov>
Description: The package takes data from PFAS biomonitoring studies (blood, plasma)
    and in vitro bioactivity data and calculates margins of exposure (MoEs). This 
    supports the manuscript titled "A Comparison of In Vitro and In Vivo Points 
    of Departure with Human Biomonitoring Levels for Per- and 
    Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS)". In the manuscript, the term MoE is replaced
    by Bioactive Concentration to Blood Concentration Ratio (BCBCR)
